## gRPC Chat Server Golang
This is a real-time chat server built using gRPC and Golang. It serves as a fundamental project for me to learn gRPC, concurrency, Mutex and channels in Golang. The concept is similar to Discord, allowing users to create servers, join servers, send messages, and engage in real-time communication.

### Features
- Unary RPC: CreateChatServer, JoinChatServer, LeaveChatServer
- Server-side streaming RPC: SendMessages
- Client-side streaming RPC: ListMessages
- Bidirectional streaming RPC: Chat

### How to run
1. Clone the repository
